# Movie Recommendation System
**Author:** Rizan Atlanta (Fariha Hossain Rizan).<br/>
**Project Type:** Data science / Machine learning.<br/>
**Status:** Completed.

## Project Overview
A personalized movie recommendation system built using PYTHON and MACHINE LEARNING. <br/>
-  Suggests movies to users based on **their preferences**.
-  Demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing, similarity algorithms, and model evaluation**.

## Features
- User-friendly **input/output interface** (notebook). <br/>
- Implements **content based filtering**.<br/>
- Generates **Top 30 recommended movies** with titles by processing similar genres.
- Includes recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, difflib.
- **Tools**: Google colab, kaggle(dataset).

## Dataset used:

 (Feel free to use it.)

## Main notebook code:

## Skills Highlighted
- Data pre-processing & cleaning.
- Similarity computation/ML model implementation.
- Python programming & library usage.
- Visualization & presentation skills.

## Future work
-Implement hybrid recommendation (content + collaborative filtering).
-Add user ratings feedback loop to improve accuracy.
-Deploy as interactive web app by either Streamlit/Django/Flask.

## References & Learning Resources:
This project was created primarily as a learning exercise, and the following resources were used for conceptual understanding rather than **direct code replication**.

- Ricci, F.,Rokach, & Shapira, B. Recommender Systems Handbook -- for understanding the theoretical foundations of collaborative and content-based recommendation systems.

- Geron, A. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow -- for practical guidance on machine learning workflows and feature engineering.

- Scikit-Learn Documentation -- for similarity metrics, vectorization techniques, and model utilities used in this project.

- Kaggle Tutorials and Notebooks -- for dataset exploration practices and baseline recommender approaches.

- Harvard CS50 -- for strengthening overall programming logic and problem solving skills applied in this project.

All implementation decisions and code were developed independently as part of my self learning process.
